We have a bunch of deployment-related ... stuff kicking around and I'm fed up
copying it from one project to the next. Particularly when I change/improve
the recipes as I go and those changes don't get to filter back to previous
projects automatically. This plugin (or hopefully, one day, gem!) attempts to
rectify that by collecting all these recipes and support tasks together.

There's a real mish-mash of stuff in here, so let's take it one at a time.

== Thanks

Some of the code has been borrowed from other sources. Hopefully I've
remembered to credit everyone! (So far, it's all mine, but when I nick from
other places, remember to update this bit!)
